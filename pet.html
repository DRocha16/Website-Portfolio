      <p  id="texto"> This website was a work for a course on innovation. We were encouraged to come up with an idea for an startup. Our idea was to use Machine Learning methods to translate the barks of a dog into a need of the dog. The reasoning was that some types of barks might associated with some types of needs of the dog like hunger, tiredness or sickness. </p>
      <p  id="texto"> So, for that we needed data to train the model, hence the first step would be to collect data from various dog owners. This website was a functional prototype of what it would be. </p>
      <p  id="texto"> My part on it was fundamentally the frontend development. </p>
